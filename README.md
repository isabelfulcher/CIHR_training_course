# Time series modeling methods for syndromic surveillance

This course consisted of five 90-minute lecutres followed by 90-minute lab sessions. The goal is to introduce attendees to concepts in time series modeling, with a particular focus on syndromic surveillance using routine health systems data. The contents available here include lecture slides and materials for the lab sessions.

### Course preparation
**Download R and RStudio**: If you plan to participate in the lab sessions, please download both R and RStudio (free statistical software) prior to the first session on March 2. Instructions for both Windows and Mac users are available [online here](https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.7.01x/3T2014/56c5437b88fa43cf828bff5371c6a924/) (please ignore the third step about SDSFoundations Package).
